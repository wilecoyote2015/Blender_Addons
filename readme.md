# Overview
This is a collection of Tools I use on (very) occasional film projects in order to enhance the Video editing workflow of blender.

It provides the following key features:
- Allow to quickly view an trim videos before adding them to the timeline
- Send strips from the timeline to the sequence editor, so that color grading etc. can be performed using the compositor as part of the VSE editing workflow
- Integration with Darktable (www.darktable.org) for color grading movie strips in the sequence editor
